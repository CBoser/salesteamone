## Outstanding P1 Warnings from Health Check

From HEALTH_CHECK_2025-11-12.md:

1. **Test Coverage** (P1)
   - Current: Minimal test coverage
   - Target: 70%+ coverage for critical paths
   - Action: Defer to Sprint 2 (Testing Foundation)

2. **CSP unsafe-inline** (P1)
   - Issue: Content Security Policy allows unsafe-inline
   - Impact: XSS vulnerability
   - Action: Review and remove unsafe-inline directives

3. **Console.log in production** (P1)
   - Issue: 15+ console.log statements in code
   - Impact: Information leakage
   - Action: Replace with proper logging service

4. **Initialize Prisma Migrations** (P1)
   - Issue: No migrations directory exists
   - Impact: Can't track schema changes, harder to deploy
   - Action: Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_schema`
   - Note: May need `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING=1` workaround

## Strategic Findings from Today's Review

### Critical Discoveries

1. **Customer Module 90% Complete** ✅
   - Backend service layer: Complete
   - Database schema: Complete
   - Validation: Complete
   - Missing: API routes (3-5 hours), Frontend UI
   - **Impact:** Saves ~2 weeks from original plan

2. **BAT Migration Not in Sprint Plan** ⚠️
   - Most urgent revenue project (Richmond + Holt)
   - 70+ Excel spreadsheets to migrate
   - No explicit sprints scheduled
   - **Action:** Insert Phase 0.5 BAT Migration (6-8 weeks)

3. **Code System Decision Blocks BAT** 🚨
   - Must choose: CSI MasterFormat, Uniformat II, Hybrid, or Custom
   - Blocks data extraction and transformation
   - **Action:** Create CODE_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md first

4. **Learning Schema Timing** 📊
   - Current plan: Sprint 11 (Week 29)
   - Recommended: Sprint 6-7 (Week 16)
   - Reason: Richmond needs variance capture from pilot day 1
   - **Impact:** 13 weeks earlier data collection

5. **Phase 0 Complete** ✅
   - 0 TypeScript errors
   - 92/100 health score
   - All services functional
   - Ready for BAT migration

### Timeline Recommendation

**Hybrid Timeline (Balanced):**
- Complete security review: 1 week
- Code System Review: 2 weeks
- BAT Migration: 6-8 weeks
- Richmond Pilot: 4 weeks
- **Total to Richmond pilot: ~13-15 weeks (~3.5 months)**

You're tracking AHEAD of all original timeline projections! 🚀

## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Code System Review (BLOCKS BAT MIGRATION)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Effort:** 10-15 hours
**Status:** Not started

**Needs:**
- Research CSI MasterFormat, Uniformat II structures
- Analyze Richmond BAT coding approach
- Analyze Holt BAT coding approach
- Decision matrix with scoring criteria
- Recommendation with rationale
- Mapping rules (BAT codes → MindFlow codes)
- Translation layer design

### 2. BAT Migration Sprints (MISSING FROM PLAN)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Effort:** 6-8 weeks total
**Status:** Not in REVISED_SPRINT_PLAN.md

**Needs:**
- Sprint BAT-1: Code System Review (Week 1-2)
- Sprint BAT-2: Data Extraction (Week 3-5)
- Sprint BAT-3: Import & Validation (Week 6-7)
- Sprint BAT-4: Final Review (Week 8)

### 3. Prisma Migrations (INFRASTRUCTURE)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Status:** Directory doesn't exist

**Needs:**
- Initialize migrations directory
- Create baseline migration from current schema
- Document migration process
- Set up for production deployments

### 4. Performance Benchmarks (VALIDATION)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Status:** Only tested with minimal data

**Needs:**
- Load test with Richmond scale (40 plans, 500+ materials)
- Concurrent user testing (5-10 estimators)
- Large takeoff performance (200+ line items)
- Database query optimization

### 5. Rollback Strategies (RISK MITIGATION)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Status:** Missing from migration docs

**Needs:**
- Database backup procedures
- Migration rollback steps
- Data validation checkpoints
- Recovery procedures
