# SESSION_PROCEDURES.md - ARCHIVED

**Archived**: 2025-11-11
**Superseded By**: docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md

## Reason for Archiving
This document was created during Day 7 documentation audit but was immediately superseded by a merged workflow that combines:
- User's existing workflow (simpler, more practical)
- SESSION_PROCEDURES.md rigor (tech debt tracking, shutdown notes)

Result: DAILY_WORKFLOW.md (cleaner, more focused)

## What Was Preserved
Key concepts from SESSION_PROCEDURES.md that made it into DAILY_WORKFLOW.md:
- Quick tech debt check at startup
- Frequent commits (20-30 min)
- Conditional CHANGELOG/REGISTER updates
- Shutdown notes template
- Emergency procedures

## Historical Value
This document shows the initial thinking about daily procedures before user feedback simplified the approach.
