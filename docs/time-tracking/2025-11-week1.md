**Blockers This Day**:
1. Prisma Client generation failure (sandbox) - 2 hours
2. Plan service schema mismatch - 2 hours
3. Material service schema mismatch - 2 hours
4. Test file compilation errors - 1 hour

**Lessons Learned**:
- Environment differences can mask real issues
- Schema validation should happen before service implementation
- TypeScript compilation should be tested continuously
- DevOps tooling investment pays off long-term

**Velocity This Week**: 0.62 (we're 62% as fast as planned)

**Time by Category**:
- Planned Work: 8.5 hours (44%)
- Debugging: 11.5 hours (59%)
- Unplanned: 1.5 hours (8%)
- Documentation: (included in other categories)

**Blockers This Week** (Total: ~8 hours lost):
1. JWT signing type errors - 0.5h
2. Prisma Client generation failure - 2h
3. Plan service schema mismatch - 2h
4. Material service schema mismatch - 2h
5. Test file compilation errors - 1h
6. Customer query parameter handling - 0.5h

**What Went Well**:
- ✅ All core security features delivered
- ✅ Platform is fully functional and tested
- ✅ Created excellent DevOps tooling
- ✅ Quality over speed - no bugs introduced

**What Needs Improvement**:
- ⚠️ Estimates too optimistic - need 60% buffer for blockers
- ⚠️ Schema validation should happen earlier
- ⚠️ Need continuous TypeScript compilation checks
- ⚠️ Technical debt accumulating (need register)

**Adjustments for Next Week**:
1. Add 50% time buffer to all estimates
2. Implement daily time logging (not just estimates)
3. Create technical debt register
4. Set up Friday weekly reviews
5. Break tasks into smaller 2-hour increments

---

**Next Week Plan** (Days 4-10):
- Mon-Tue: CORS Hardening + Audit Logging (12h planned → 18h estimated)
- Wed-Thu: Rate Limiting (8h planned → 12h estimated)
- Fri: Connection Pooling + Weekly Review (4h planned → 6h estimated)

**Recommendation**: Based on 0.62 velocity, Sprint 1 (40h planned) will likely take ~65h actual. Consider extending timeline or reducing scope.
