Why not?

BLOCKING: Dependencies not installed (npm install never run)
BLOCKING: Database migrations missing (directory gitignored)
BLOCKING: 13 API endpoints will fail due to schema mismatches
BLOCKING: No .env file (only .env.example exists)
CRITICAL: 9 of 14 pages are complete placeholders (60%+ of UI missing)
🔴 TOP 10 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before ANY Testing)
1. Dependencies Not Installed - SHOW STOPPER
Category: Setup
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - Prevents everything
Description: npm install has never been run. All 37 dependencies are UNMET.
Impact: Application cannot start. Zero functionality available.
Fix Required:
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
Estimated Time: 15 minutes
Files Affected: backend/package.json, frontend/package.json
Line Numbers: N/A (installation issue)
2. Database Migrations Missing - PRODUCTION BLOCKER
Category: Database
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - Violates Prisma best practices
Description: backend/prisma/migrations/ directory doesn't exist AND is gitignored
Impact:
Cannot deploy to any environment
No migration history or audit trail
Fresh database setup impossible
Team collaboration broken
Fix Required:
Remove from .gitignore (line 53)
Run npx prisma migrate dev --name init
Commit migrations to version control
Estimated Time: 30 minutes
Files Affected: .gitignore:53, backend/prisma/migrations/ (missing)
Prisma Docs: Migrations MUST be version controlled
3. Plan Service Schema Mismatch - RUNTIME FAILURE
Category: Backend / Database
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - 5 endpoints will crash
Description: Plan creation uses fields that don't exist in database schema
Impact: POST /api/plans, PUT /api/plans/:id, GET /api/plans (with filters) all FAIL
Fix Required: Update field mappings:
// backend/src/services/plan.ts:76-88
planNumber → code        // Line 79
squareFootage → sqft     // Line 81
stories → type          // Line 87 (enum)
garageSpaces → garage   // Line 88
customerId → REMOVE     // Line 76 (doesn't exist in schema)
description → REMOVE    // Line 86 (doesn't exist in schema)
Estimated Time: 2 hours
Files Affected:
backend/src/services/plan.ts:76-88, 201
backend/src/routes/plan.ts:96-99
Line Numbers: See above
4. Material Service Schema Mismatch - RUNTIME FAILURE
Category: Backend / Database
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - 8 endpoints will crash
Description: Material creation uses non-existent fields
Impact: POST /api/materials, PUT /api/materials/:id, ALL pricing endpoints FAIL
Fix Required: Update field mappings:
// backend/src/services/material.ts:46-70
name → REMOVE (not in schema)
unit → unitOfMeasure
manufacturer → REMOVE
notes → REMOVE
ADD: vendorCost (REQUIRED in schema, missing in service)
Estimated Time: 2 hours
Files Affected:
backend/src/services/material.ts:1, 46-70, 179, 481
backend/src/routes/material.ts:all pricing routes

5. MaterialPricing Model Doesn't Exist - IMPORT ERROR
Category: Backend
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - 6 pricing endpoints broken
Description: Code imports MaterialPricing model that was never defined
Impact: All 6 pricing endpoints (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/materials/*/pricing) will fail
Fix Required: Replace MaterialPricing with PricingHistory (the actual schema model)
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Files Affected: backend/src/services/material.ts:1
Line Numbers: Line 1 (import statement)
6. No .env File - CONFIGURATION MISSING
Category: Setup / Security
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - App cannot start
Description: Only .env.example exists, no actual .env file
Impact:
DATABASE_URL undefined → Prisma connection fails
JWT_SECRET undefined → Uses weak default "default-secret-change-me"
Server cannot start
Fix Required:
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
# Edit with real values
Estimated Time: 10 minutes
Files Affected: backend/.env, frontend/.env (both missing)

Category: Security
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - Production security risk
Description: CORS allows ANY origin to make requests
Impact: Any website can call your API (CSRF risk, data theft)
Fix Required:
// backend/src/index.ts:17
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['http://localhost:5173'],
  credentials: true
}));
Estimated Time: 15 minutes
Files Affected: backend/src/index.ts:17
8. Default JWT Secret Hardcoded - SECURITY VULNERABILITY
Category: Security
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - Authentication bypass risk
Description: JWT uses weak default secret if env var not set
Impact: Attackers can forge authentication tokens
Fix Required:
// backend/src/services/auth.ts:7
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!JWT_SECRET || JWT_SECRET === 'default-secret-change-me') {
  throw new Error('JWT_SECRET must be set and changed from default');
}
Estimated Time: 15 minutes
Files Affected: backend/src/services/auth.ts:7
9. 9 of 14 Pages are Placeholders - NO FUNCTIONALITY
Category: Frontend
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL - 64% of UI missing
Description: Dashboard, Reports, Settings, Plans, Materials, Jobs, Takeoffs, POs, Schedule are all "coming soon" placeholders
Impact: Application appears complete but has no actual functionality beyond customer management
Fix Required: Implement all placeholder pages (200+ hours estimated)
Estimated Time: 200+ hours
Files Affected:
frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (static data)
frontend/src/pages/Reports.tsx (placeholder)

10. No Validation Schemas for Material/Plan APIs - DATA INTEGRITY RISK
Category: Backend / Validation
Severity: 🟡 HIGH - Security and data quality risk
Description: Unlike Customer routes, Material and Plan routes have NO Zod validation
Impact:
Malformed data can reach database
Type coercion errors
Security vulnerabilities (injection attacks)
Fix Required: Create validators/material.ts and validators/plan.ts (follow customer.ts pattern)
Estimated Time: 4 hours
Files Affected:
backend/src/validators/material.ts (missing)
backend/src/validators/plan.ts (missing)
