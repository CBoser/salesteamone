# MindFlow Platform - Revised Sprint Plan (Solo Development)
**Version**: 2.0 (Foundation-First Approach)
**Created**: 2025-11-11
**Developer**: Solo (Corey)
**Capacity**: 5-7.5 hours/week (60-90 min/day, 5 days/week)
**Review Cadence**: End of each sprint

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current Reality**:
- Foundation has critical issues (49+ TypeScript errors)
- Must repair before continuing Sprint 1
- No external validation needed until later
- Focus: Build the vision, validate internally at sprint boundaries

**Revised Approach**:
```
Phase 0: Foundation Repair (Weeks 0-3) ← START HERE
    ↓
Phase 1: Security Foundation (Weeks 4-15) - Sprints 1-5
    ↓
Phase 2: Core Business (Weeks 16-28) - Sprints 6-10
    ↓
Phase 3: Learning Features (Weeks 29-52) - Sprints 11-18
    ↓
Phase 4: Operations (Weeks 53-70) - Sprints 19-22
```

**Key Changes from Original**:
- ✅ Added Phase 0 (Foundation Repair) - 3 weeks
- ✅ Removed external validation gates
- ✅ Self-review at end of each sprint
- ✅ Can pivot/adjust after any sprint
- ✅ Build full vision, validate with customers later (after Week 32+)

## 🎯 PHASE 0: FOUNDATION REPAIR (IMMEDIATE)

**Duration**: Weeks 0-3 (12-20 hours)
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete before Sprint 1

### Week 0: Diagnosis (3-4 hours)

**Goals**:
- [ ] Remove custom type declarations (expose all errors)
- [ ] Document all 55+ errors in spreadsheet
- [ ] Audit schema vs code for all models
- [ ] Create repair strategy document

**Tasks**:
1. **Remove** `backend/src/types/prisma.d.ts` → Backup first
2. **Run** `npm run build` → Save full error output
3. **Create** error tracking spreadsheet:
   - Column A: Service File
   - Column B: Line Number
   - Column C: Error Message
   - Column D: Root Cause
   - Column E: Fix Strategy
   - Column F: Status
4. **Audit** each service vs schema:
   - Customer: Expected fields vs actual fields
   - Material: Expected models vs actual models
   - Plan: Expected relations vs actual relations

**Deliverable**: Complete error inventory with fix strategy

**Time**: 3-4 hours (4-6 sessions @ 60 min each)

---

### Week 1: Customer Service Repair (4-6 hours)

**Goals**:
- [ ] Fix all 13 errors in customer.ts
- [ ] Customer CRUD operations working

   - Remove references to non-existent relations
   - Fix type annotations (remove `: any`)

3. **Testing**:
   - Create smoke test for customer CRUD
   - Verify database operations work
   - Test with real data

**Deliverable**: Customer service fully functional (0 errors)

**Time**: 4-6 hours (5-7 sessions)

**Success Criteria**:
```bash
# These commands should succeed:
npm run build  # 0 errors in customer.ts
npm test -- customer  # All tests pass

# Manual test:
# 1. Create customer
# 2. Get customer by ID

3. **Testing**:
   - Smoke test for plan CRUD

**Deliverable**: Material & Plan services functional (0 errors)

**Success Criteria**:
```bash

## 🚨 PIVOT TRIGGERS

Stop and reassess if:

**Phase 0**:
- [ ] Repairs exceed 25 hours total
- [ ] More than 60 total errors discovered
- [ ] Schema has fundamental design flaws

**Phase 1**:
- [ ] Security implementation taking >50 hours
- [ ] Can't get tests working properly
- [ ] Feeling burned out

**Phase 2**:
- [ ] Core features taking >60 hours
- [ ] Performance issues emerging
- [ ] Quality concerns mounting

**Phase 3**:
- [ ] Learning features taking >100 hours
- [ ] Pattern detection not working
- [ ] Questioning if learning features add value

**Any Phase**:
- [ ] Energy level consistently Low
- [ ] Opportunity cost too high
- [ ] Better opportunity identified
- [ ] Lost motivation for project

---

## 💪 MOTIVATION & SUSTAINABILITY

### Remember Your Why
- Learning-first differentiation is genuinely novel
- Schema architecture is sophisticated
- Market opportunity is real (5-15% variance is painful)
- You have the vision and capability

### Sustainable Pace
- 60-90 min/day is manageable
- Sprint reviews prevent burnout
- Can pause/pivot at any sprint boundary
- No external pressure - build your vision

### Celebrate Progress
- ✅ End of Phase 0: Foundation solid (first major milestone)
- ✅ End of Phase 1: Security-hardened platform
- ✅ End of Phase 2: Full CRUD functionality
- ✅ End of Phase 3: Learning system working (THE DIFFERENTIATOR)
- ✅ End of Phase 4: Production-ready platform

### When to Validate Externally

**Good Times**:
- End of Phase 3 (Week 52) - Show learning features
- After Phase 4 (Week 70) - Full platform demo
- When you need customer input on direction

**Not-Yet Times**:
- During Phase 0-2 - Still building foundation
- When you're clear on what to build
- When external feedback would slow you down

**You'll know when** - Trust your instinct

---

## 🎯 FINAL THOUGHTS

**This is your roadmap** to building the MindFlow vision:

- **Phase 0-1**: Get foundation rock-solid (16 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Build core business features (14 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Build the differentiator - learning system (24 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Production-ready operations (18 weeks)

**Total: 72 weeks (~17 months) of focused, sustainable work**

**You know what you want to build. Build it.**

**Solo development is powerful** - you can move fast, stay focused, and build your complete vision without compromise.

**Sprint reviews keep you honest** - check progress, adjust course, maintain quality.

**External validation comes later** - after you've built enough to show the full vision (Phase 3+).

**Trust the process. Execute the plan. Build the platform.** 🚀
