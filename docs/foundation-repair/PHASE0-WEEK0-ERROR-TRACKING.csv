KNOWN SCHEMA/CODE SYNC ISSUES (From Strategic Analysis):
"backend/src/services/customer.ts",N/A,SCHEMA_MISMATCH,"Code expects 'name' field, schema has 'customerName'","Field name mismatch between code expectations and schema","Update all references from 'name' to 'customerName' after Prisma Client works",HIGH,PENDING,"13 errors expected once Prisma Client generated"
"backend/src/services/material.ts",N/A,SCHEMA_MISMATCH,"Code expects 'MaterialPricing' model, schema has 'PricingHistory'","Model name mismatch","Rename all MaterialPricing references to PricingHistory",CRITICAL,PENDING,"22 errors expected - most complex service"
"backend/src/services/plan.ts",N/A,SCHEMA_MISMATCH,"PlanType enum mismatch: code expects PRODUCTION/SEMI_CUSTOM/FULL_CUSTOM, schema has SINGLE_STORY/TWO_STORY/THREE_STORY/DUPLEX/TOWNHOME","Enum values completely different","Update PlanType enum usage throughout code to match schema",HIGH,PENDING,"14 errors expected"
"backend/src/services/plan.ts",N/A,SCHEMA_MISMATCH,"Code may expect customerId field on Plan model","Potential missing relation field","Verify if customerId is in schema, add if needed",MEDIUM,PENDING,"Part of 14 errors"

SUMMARY:
"Total Current Errors",63,N/A,"63 TypeScript compilation errors","Prisma Client not generated + error handling + schema mismatches","1. Generate Prisma Client (environment fix needed), 2. Fix error typing (24 errors), 3. Fix schema sync issues (~49 errors)",N/A,N/A,"Once Prisma Client generated, expect 49+ additional errors to appear"
"Critical Path","1. Prisma Client Generation","BLOCKER","Must resolve network restrictions OR copy pre-generated client from Windows environment",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Without this, cannot proceed with repairs"
"Estimated Total Errors","~112","ANALYSIS","63 current + 49 hidden schema/code sync errors = 112 total",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Iceberg ratio: 49 hidden / 63 visible = 0.78 (less than expected 8:1 ratio from Windows build)"
