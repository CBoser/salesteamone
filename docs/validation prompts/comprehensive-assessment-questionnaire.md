2. Who are the users?
3. What's the timeline?
4. What's the budget?
5. What are must-have features?
6. What are deal-breaker constraints?
7. What does success look like?
8. What existing systems must integrate?
9. Who are key stakeholders?
10. What's the biggest risk?

## PHASE 2: TARGETED DEEP DIVE

Based on Phase 1, ask follow-ups:
- If B2B: Enterprise requirements
