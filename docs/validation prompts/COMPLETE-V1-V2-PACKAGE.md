## 🎁 Bonus: What ChatGPT Got Right

ChatGPT's analysis identified the key issues:

✅ **"Prompts should have modes"** - V2 has Quick/Standard/Full
✅ **"Track baselines, not just snapshots"** - V2 compares to baseline
✅ **"Scope selection needed"** - V2 has full/changed/focus
✅ **"Need a 'when to use what' guide"** - V2 has comprehensive guide

**But also what I added:**
✅ Time estimates for every mode
✅ Smart defaults (standard mode, weekly tier)

✅ Real usage patterns (daily/weekly/monthly)
✅ Success criteria per timeframe
