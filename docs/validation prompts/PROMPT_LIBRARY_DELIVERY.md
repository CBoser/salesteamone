## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see all the prompt files"
**Answer:** I've created the core prompts and framework. The folder structure is ready for all 23 prompts - just ask me to create specific ones you need next!

### "How do I customize for Python/Go/etc?"
**Answer:** Each prompt includes customization examples. Replace TypeScript commands with your language's equivalents.

### "The prompt is too long"
**Answer:** Most prompts have a "Quick Mode" section. Use that for common cases.

### "Not getting consistent results from Claude"
**Answer:** Use the meta-prompt "make-prompt-reusable.md" to improve specificity and add output format examples.
