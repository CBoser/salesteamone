## 🔄 Phase Review Process

At the end of each phase, conduct a **non-negotiable review**:

1. **Assessment**: Review all sprint objectives vs actual completion
2. **Testing**: Run comprehensive phase test suite
3. **Security**: Complete security audit for phase
4. **Documentation**: Verify all documentation complete
5. **Retrospective**: What worked? What didn't?
6. **Adaptation**: Adjust remaining sprints based on learnings
7. **Approval**: Explicit approval to proceed to next phase

**Review Template**: See `docs/sprints/phase-reviews/PHASE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`
