# Lumber Specifications for ReadyFrame Systems

Complete reference for lumber grades, dimensions, stock lengths, and material properties used in ReadyFrame construction.

## Lumber Grades

### No.2 Grade (ReadyFrame/Precut Components)

**Usage:** All ReadyFrame precut components
**Characteristics:**
- Kiln-dried (KD)
- Structural grade
- Suitable for precision cutting
- Tighter dimensional tolerances

**ReadyFrame Components Using No.2:**
- Bottom plates (cut to panel length)
- First/inner top plates (cut to panel length)
- Jack studs/trimmers (cut to opening heights)
- Headers (cut to opening widths, 2-ply)
- Window sills (cut to opening widths)
- Sill cripples (cut to calculated heights)
- Header cripples (cut to calculated heights)
- Pads and fillers (1/2" × 5-1/2" pieces)
- Non-standard length flat studs
- Specialty blocking

### DF Stud Grade (Loose/Full-Length Components)

**Usage:** All Loose full-length studs
**Characteristics:**
- Douglas Fir species
- Stud grade (slightly lower than No.2 but adequate for full-length vertical members)
- Kiln-dried (KD)
- Cost-effective for high-volume stud applications

**Loose Components Using DF Stud:**
- Common studs (wall field)
- King studs (at openings)
- Critical studs (layout preservation)
- Full-length flat studs
- Field-adjustable studs

### Grade Selection Rationale

**No.2 for Precut:**
- Precise dimensions needed for factory cutting
- Components must fit together accurately
- Higher quality prevents assembly issues

**DF Stud for Loose:**
- Full-length pieces don't require precision cutting
- Field installation allows minor adjustments
- Cost savings on high-volume items

## Standard Lumber Dimensions

### Nominal vs. Actual Sizes

| Nominal Size | Actual Thickness | Actual Width |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| 2×4          | 1-1/2"           | 3-1/2"       |
| 2×6          | 1-1/2"           | 5-1/2"       |
| 2×8          | 1-1/2"           | 7-1/4"       |

## Board Feet Conversions

### Formula
```
Board Feet = (Thickness" × Width" × Length') / 12
```

### Linear Feet to Board Feet

**Per Linear Foot:**
```
2×4:  0.667 BF/LF  (2 × 4 / 12)
2×6:  1.000 BF/LF  (2 × 6 / 12)
2×8:  1.333 BF/LF  (2 × 8 / 12)
2×10: 1.667 BF/LF  (2 × 10 / 12)
2×12: 2.000 BF/LF  (2 × 12 / 12)
```

### Board Feet by Stock Length

**2×4 Stock Lengths:**
```
2':  1.33 BF
4':  2.67 BF
6':  4.00 BF
8':  5.33 BF
10': 6.67 BF
12': 8.00 BF

```

## Weight Calculations

### Approximate Weights (Kiln-Dried)

**Douglas Fir Density:** ~32 lbs/cubic foot

**Weight per Board Foot:**
```
Weight = 32 lbs/ft³ × (1 BF / 12 board feet per ft³)
Weight ≈ 2.67 lbs per BF
```

**Weight by Size (per Linear Foot):**
```
2×4:  1.78 lbs/LF  (0.667 BF × 2.67)
2×6:  2.67 lbs/LF  (1.000 BF × 2.67)
2×8:  3.56 lbs/LF  (1.333 BF × 2.67)
2×10: 4.45 lbs/LF  (1.667 BF × 2.67)
2×12: 5.34 lbs/LF  (2.000 BF × 2.67)
```

### Panel Weight Examples

**Example 1: Simple 30' Wall Panel**
```
Plates (2×6): 60 LF × 2.67 lbs/LF = 160 lbs
Studs (2×6): 23 studs × 8.7' × 2.67 lbs/LF = 535 lbs
Total: ~695 lbs
```

**Example 2: Panel from Image (E102)**
```
Specifications:
- Wall Length: 84-1/2" (7.04')
- Stud Count: 7
- Stud Size: 2×6
- Stud Height: 104-5/8" (8.72')
- BF: 75
- Weight: 175 lbs (from cutting list)

Calculation check:
75 BF × 2.67 lbs/BF ≈ 200 lbs (close to listed 175 lbs)
Variance likely due to actual vs. theoretical density
```

## Material Optimization

### Stock Length Selection Strategy

**Principle:** Minimize waste while reducing piece count

**Example 1: 12.5 LF Bottom Plate Needed**
```
Option A: 1×12' + 1×2' = 14' total (1.5' waste)
Option B: 1×10' + 1×4' = 14' total (1.5' waste)
Option C: 1×14' = 14' total (1.5' waste)

Select: Option C (fewest pieces, same waste)
```

**Example 2: 84.5 LF Plates Needed**
```
Option A: 5×16' + 1×6' = 86' (1.5' waste)
Option B: 4×20' + 1×6' = 86' (1.5' waste)
Option C: 7×12' = 84' (0' waste but 0.5' short)

Select: Option B (fewer pieces, adequate length)
```

### Typical Waste Factors

**Industry Standards:**
```
Plates: 5-10% waste (lapping, miters, field cuts)
Studs: 2-5% waste (minor damage, field adjustments)
Headers: 10-15% waste (exact lengths required)
Cripples: 15-20% waste (short pieces, more cuts)
```

## Quality Standards

### Moisture Content

**Kiln-Dried (KD) Standard:**
```
Target: 19% moisture content or less
Typical: 15-19% MC at delivery
Maximum: 19% MC per building codes
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Dimensional stability (less shrinkage after installation)
- Reduced warping and twisting
- Better fastener holding
- Mold/decay resistance

### Defects and Limits

**Acceptable Defects (No.2 Grade):**
- Knots up to 1/3 of width
- Checks and splits not exceeding certain depths
- Wane on edges (limited)
- Minor warp within tolerance

**Unacceptable Defects:**
- Excessive warp (beyond 1/4" per 6')
- Splits extending through thickness
- Large loose knots
- Significant decay or damage

### Inspection Points

**Receipt Inspection:**
1. Verify grade stamps on packages
2. Check moisture content (sample basis)
3. Inspect for visible damage
4. Confirm dimensions match specifications
5. Verify quantities against packing lists

## Regional Variations

### Species Availability

**Western US (Typical):**
- Douglas Fir (DF)
- Hem-Fir (HF)

**Southern US (Typical):**
- Southern Yellow Pine (SYP)
- Southern Pine (SP)

**Notes:**
- ReadyFrame specs typically call for DF
- Substitutions must meet equivalent grade standards
- Verify with local building codes

### Climate Considerations

**Dry Climates:**
- Standard KD lumber adequate
- Less concern about moisture gain

**Humid Climates:**
- May require moisture barriers
- Storage considerations critical
- Site protection important

## Cost Factors

### Approximate Pricing (Relative)

**Grade Premium:**
```
DF Stud Grade: Baseline (1.0×)
No.2 Grade: 1.1-1.3× DF Stud cost
Premium grades: 1.5-2.0× DF Stud cost
```

**Size Premiums:**
```
2×4: Baseline (1.0×)
2×6: 1.3-1.5× per BF
2×8: 1.5-1.7× per BF
2×10: 1.7-2.0× per BF
```

**Length Premiums:**
```
8'-12': Baseline (1.0×)
14'-16': 1.1-1.2× per LF
18'-20': 1.3-1.5× per LF
22'+: 1.5-2.0× per LF
```

### Cost Optimization Strategy

1. **Maximize DF Stud usage** (cost-effective for full-length pieces)
2. **Optimize No.2 cuts** (minimize waste from stock lengths)
3. **Standard lengths preferred** (8', 10', 12', 16' typically best pricing)
4. **Volume discounts** (aggregate orders across projects)

### Conversion Quick Reference

**Linear Feet → Board Feet:**
```python
def lf_to_bf(lf, width):
    """Convert linear feet to board feet"""
    return lf * width / 12

# Example: 100 LF of 2×6
bf = lf_to_bf(100, 6)  # = 50 BF
```

**Board Feet → Weight:**
```python
def bf_to_weight(bf, species='DF'):
    """Estimate weight from board feet"""
    density = 2.67  # lbs/BF for Douglas Fir
    return bf * density

# Example: 50 BF panel weight
weight = bf_to_weight(50)  # ≈ 133.5 lbs
```

**Stock Length Optimization:**
```python
import math

def optimize_stock(required_lf, stock_lengths=[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,20]):
    """Find optimal combination of stock lengths"""
    best_combo = None
    min_waste = float('inf')
    
    # Try each stock length as starting point
    for primary in reversed(stock_lengths):
        if primary >= required_lf:
            waste = primary - required_lf
            if waste < min_waste:
                min_waste = waste
                best_combo = [primary]
        else:
            remaining = required_lf - primary
            for secondary in stock_lengths:
                if primary + secondary >= required_lf:
                    waste = (primary + secondary) - required_lf
                    if waste < min_waste:
                        min_waste = waste
                        best_combo = [primary, secondary]
                    break
    
    return best_combo, min_waste
```
