## 📞 QUESTIONS & TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"I'm not sure where to start"**
→ Read the Dashboard, then do the 2-hour audit on Monday

### **"This seems overwhelming"**
→ Just focus on Week 1. Everything builds from there.

### **"What if I find issues during the audit?"**
→ Document them! That's the point of the audit.

### **"How do I know if my coding standards are right?"**
→ Get team review (William, Alicia). Their input is crucial.

### **"What if the pricing updater is harder to fix than expected?"**
→ The Action Plan has detailed VBA code. Start there.

### **"Should I rename tables before or after adding plans?"**
→ After. Get standards right first, then add content.

### **"What about the Manor Homes BAT?"**
→ Phase 2, after March 2026 merger. Focus on Richmond & Holt now.
