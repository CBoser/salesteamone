## 🎪 THE BIG PICTURE

### March 2026 Merger Timeline:
```
NOW (Nov 2025)                    MERGER (Mar 2026)
     |---> 4 MONTHS <---|
     
Week 1-4:  ████████░░░░  Foundation & Critical Fixes
Week 5-8:  ████████░░░░  Content & Formatting
Week 9-12: ████████░░░░  Infrastructure & Testing
           ├─────────────┤
           BUFFER: 8 weeks before merger for production use
```

**Key Advantage:** You'll have a unified, tested system 2 months before the merger!

---

## 🔥 WHAT MAKES THIS URGENT

1. **Pricing Tool Broken** → Causing daily friction
2. **Richmond Missing 70 Plans** → Can't quote many jobs
3. **No Standardization** → Hard to automate or scale
4. **Merger in 4 Months** → Need time to test in production

**The 12-week plan gives you 8 weeks of production testing before March!**

---

## 💡 KEY DECISIONS NEEDED (Week 1)

Answer these to unblock work:

1. **Who reviews coding standards?**
   - William Hatley (Richmond)?
   - Alicia Vandehey (Holt)?
   - Dave Templeton?

2. **Where are arch/engineering dates?**
   - Plan files?
   - Project management system?
   - Emails/records?

3. **What price levels are actually used?**
   - All 5 levels active in Richmond?
   - IWP vs RL distinction in Holt?

4. **SharePoint access available?**
   - For database storage?
   - Who's the admin?

## 🎯 YOUR FIRST TASK (This Week)

**Monday, Nov 11 - 2 hours:**

Open these sheets and document patterns:
- Richmond: "Item Pricing" → Note numbering format
- Holt: IWP sheet → Note numbering format
- Holt: RL sheet → Note numbering format
- Both: Plan Index → Note elevation codes

**Look for:**
- Prefixes (letters before numbers)
- Number ranges (1000-1999, 2000-2999, etc.)
- Suffixes (letters after numbers)
- Special characters (dashes, underscores)
- Inconsistencies or duplicates

**Document in:** Google Doc or OneNote

**This 2-hour task starts everything else!**
