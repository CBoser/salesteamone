VALIDATION QUESTIONS PREPARED
================================================================================

FOR WILLIAM HATLEY (Richmond):
Q1: Does XGREAT use the same materials in all plans?
Q2: When updating XGREAT, do you update all plans together?
Q3: Are there options that are plan-specific by design?
Q4: Do elevations share plan-level attributes (name, builder)?
Q5: When updating plan info, update all elevations?

FOR ALICIA VANDEHEY (Holt):
Q1: Why do option codes include plan numbers (167 vs 164)?
Q2: Is it because materials differ or for tracking?
Q3: Would universal packs work if materials are same?
Q4: Do elevations share plan-level attributes?

These questions must be answered during Wednesday Session 2.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Based on Tuesday Session 1 analysis:

DECISION #1: Plan-Pack Relationships
Recommendation: Option A (Universal Packs) with validation
Confidence: MEDIUM (needs expert validation)
Key Question: Do materials vary by plan?

DECISION #2: Plan-Elevation Modeling
Recommendation: Option B (Elevation as Dimension)
Confidence: HIGH (strong evidence from Plan Index)
Key Evidence: Richmond Plan Index separates Model + Elevations

DECISION #3: Option Code Philosophy
Recommendation: Option C (Both via Translation Layer)
Confidence: HIGH (respects both teams' workflows)
Key Benefit: Richmond keeps mnemonic, Holt keeps systematic
