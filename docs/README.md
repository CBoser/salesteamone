## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Developers

**First Time Setup**:
1. Read [../QUICK_START.md](../QUICK_START.md) for platform setup
2. Read [../DEVOPS_TOOL.md](../DEVOPS_TOOL.md) for DevOps tooling
3. Read [PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md](PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md) for workflow

**Daily Workflow**:
1. Start of day: Review yesterday's progress
2. During work: Log time using [time-tracking/TEMPLATE.md](time-tracking/TEMPLATE.md)
3. End of day: Update time log, document blockers
4. Friday: Do weekly review (30 min)

## 🎯 Current Project Status

**Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Security Features
**Days Completed**: 3 / 10
**Overall Completion**: ~25%
**Current Velocity**: 0.62 (slower than planned, but quality-focused)

### What's Working
- ✅ All core security features delivered (JWT, headers, seed security)
- ✅ Platform fully functional and tested
- ✅ Excellent DevOps tooling created
- ✅ Quality focus - zero bugs introduced

### What Needs Attention
- ⚠️ 58% time overrun on Days 1-3 (blockers)
- ⚠️ Technical debt accumulating (7 items, ~22-32 hours)
- ⚠️ Plan and Material routes disabled (schema mismatches)
- ⚠️ Sprint timeline may need adjustment

### Next Steps
- Complete Sprint 1 Days 4-10
- Weekly reviews every Friday
- Technical debt paydown in Sprint 2
- Velocity-based estimate adjustments

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

### When to Create Documentation

**Daily**:
- End of day time log
- Blocker notes

**Weekly**:
- Friday weekly review
- Update technical debt register

**As Needed**:
- Technical debt items (immediately when created)
- Architecture decisions (for significant choices)
- Incident reports (for major issues)

**End of Sprint**:
- Sprint retrospective
- Lessons learned

### Documentation Principles

1. **Write for Future You** - Assume you'll forget everything
2. **Be Honest** - Don't fudge time or blocker data
3. **Be Specific** - "Fixed bug" vs "Fixed schema mismatch causing 18+ TypeScript errors"
4. **Include Context** - Why decisions were made, not just what
5. **Link Liberally** - Connect related docs

## 🛠️ Tools and Processes

### Time Tracking
- **Tool**: Markdown files (version controlled)
- **Format**: See [time-tracking/TEMPLATE.md](time-tracking/TEMPLATE.md)
- **Frequency**: Daily updates, weekly summaries

### Technical Debt
- **Tool**: Markdown register
- **Format**: See [technical-debt/REGISTER.md](technical-debt/REGISTER.md)
- **Review**: Weekly on Fridays

### Version Control
- **Commits**: Small, logical, descriptive
- **Branches**: Feature branches for significant work
- **Main Branch**: Always deployable

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (So Far)

### Technical
1. **Environment Parity Matters** - Sandbox vs. local differences masked issues
2. **Schema Validation Early** - Should validate before implementing services
3. **TypeScript Compilation Continuous** - Catch errors early, not at end
4. **DevOps Tooling Pays Off** - Upfront investment saves time later

### Process
1. **Time Estimates Were Optimistic** - Need 50%+ buffer for blockers
2. **Formal Time Tracking Essential** - Can't improve what you don't measure
3. **Technical Debt Needs Registry** - Easy to lose track without documentation
4. **Weekly Reviews Prevent Drift** - Catch issues before they compound

### Project Management
1. **Quality Over Speed** - Zero bugs is worth slower pace
2. **Blockers Are Normal** - 59% of time spent debugging is high but not abnormal for setup
3. **Scope Creep is Real** - DevOps tool was valuable but unplanned
4. **Communication is Key** - Clear documentation prevents confusion

---

## 🚨 Red Flags - When to Escalate

Pay attention if any of these occur:

1. **Velocity < 0.5** - Something is seriously wrong
2. **Technical debt > 40 hours** - Need dedicated cleanup sprint
3. **Same blocker 3+ days** - Need different approach
4. **Burnout feelings** - Take break, reduce scope
5. **Lost sight of goal** - Review roadmap, refocus

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Sprint Success
- 80%+ of objectives completed
- Velocity 0.6-1.2 (sustainable)
- No P1/P2 bugs introduced
- Technical debt stable or decreasing

### Project Success
- On track for timeline (or adjusted)
- High quality code
- Good documentation
- Sustainable pace

### Personal Success
- Learning and growing
- Enjoying the process
- Proud of the work
- Work-life balance
